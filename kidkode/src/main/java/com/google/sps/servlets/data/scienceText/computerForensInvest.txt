Computer Forensics Investigation
Computer Forensics investigators reconstruct and analyze digital information help solve computer-related crimes. They look into incidents of hacking, find out who committed computer attacks, and recover lost or stolen data. They often recover data from damaged or erased computers, gather and maintain evidence, write and review investigative reports, work with computers and other electronic equipment, and work closely with other police officers and detectives.
