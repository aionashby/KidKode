Video Game Technical Art
Video Game Technical Art is a new concept and role in the video game industry. They actcas a link between the artists and the computer programmers working on a game. This role requires someone who is not only artistic (as in, can draw or sculpt, design etc.), but also has more technical skills, like rigging (creating a moving skeleton) and computer programming as well. If you like combining video games and art this may be the track for you!
