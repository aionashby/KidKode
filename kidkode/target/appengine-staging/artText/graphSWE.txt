Computer Graphics Software Engineering
Computer Graphics software engineers create graphics systems that are used to design and create software applications like video games and operating systems! They write code, use math skills and work with graphic designers and art directors so that they can make tools for them to use! They also need to have a great understanding of math, specifically of 3-d shapes. If you want to create cool tools that can be used to make games and movies, being a graphic software engineer might be for you!
