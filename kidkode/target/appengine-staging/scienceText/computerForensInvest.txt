Computer Forensics Investigation
Forensic computer investigators reconstruct and analyze digital information to aid in investigations and solve computer-related crimes. They look into incidents of hacking, trace sources of computer attacks, and recover lost or stolen data. They often recover data from damaged or erased hard drives, trace hacks, gather and maintain evidence, write and review investigative reports, work with computers and other electronic equipment, and work closely with other police officers and detectives.
