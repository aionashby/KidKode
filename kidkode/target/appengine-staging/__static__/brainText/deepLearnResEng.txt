Deep Learning Research Engineering
Deep learning research engineers are a kind of computer scientist. Deep learning is related to artificial intelligence (the ability of a computer to "think" or "learn")! Their goal is to develop (think about and make) systems that act like the human brain! To do this, they use neural networks, which are structures that work in a way similar to the human brain.
