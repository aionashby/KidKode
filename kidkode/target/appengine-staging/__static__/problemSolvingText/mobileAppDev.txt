Mobile Application Developer
Mobile Application Developers create software for mobile devices. Mobile developers write programs inside of a mobile development environment using the Objective C, C++, C# or Java programming languages. A mobile app developer chooses the operating system (a.k.a. mobile platform) they will develop for, such as Google's Android or Apple's iOS, then learns the programming languages and software development environment for that platform.
