Game Director
A game director is the force behind the creative aspects of a video game. Theyâ€™re similar to a film director because their vision shapes and defines the game. Together with a team of game designers, they create a road map for the game at large. Once the vision is laid out, they work with a development team to fill in all the technical, aesthetic, and narrative details.
