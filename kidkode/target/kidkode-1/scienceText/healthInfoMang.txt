Health Information Management
Health information management (HIM) is the practice of collecting, understanding, and protecting digital and traditional medical information that is important to providing quality patient care. It is a combination of business, science, and information technology. HIM professionals are highly trained in the latest information management technology applications and understand the workflow in any healthcare provider organization from large hospital systems to private doctors' offices. They are very important to the daily management of health information and electronic health records (EHRs). They make sure a patientâ€™s health information and records are complete, accurate, and protected.
