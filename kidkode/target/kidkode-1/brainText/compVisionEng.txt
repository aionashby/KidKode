Computer Vision Engineering
A computer vision engineer often applies computer vision research that is based on a bunch of data (information) to solve real-world problems! They spend much of their time researching and implementing machine learning principles and computer vision for the companies they are working for. They work closely with other people to develop embedded architectures (technology with both hardware and software that serves a certain purpose within a bigger piece of technology). Computer vision engineers gain experience with a variety of systems, such as image recognition and machine learning!
