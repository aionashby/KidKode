Deep Learning Research Engineering
Deep learning research engineers are a kind of computer scientist. They specialize in using deep learning platforms for specific types of programming tasks related to artificial intelligence. Their goal is to develop programming systems that mimic brain functions. To do this, they use neural networks, which are data structures similar to the structure of the human brain.
