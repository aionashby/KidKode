Machine Learning Engineering
Machine learning engineers design self-running software (a set of instruction that tells a computer what to do) that is able to "learn" on its own ! Each time the software performs an operation, it uses those results to carry out future operations in an even better way! This is how the software, or machine, “learns.”
