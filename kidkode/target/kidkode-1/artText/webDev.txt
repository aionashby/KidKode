Web Development
Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet (a network like the Internet but instead of connecting people globally, it connects people only within a specific organization). Web development can range from developing a simple single page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social networking services. Imagine being able to create your own website from the ground up! Imagine being able to create a page dedicated to everything you love! If this intrigues you then Web Development may be the way to go!
