Data Visualization Engineer
Data visualization engineers work collaboratively with data scientists, business consultants, and other software engineers to create data visualizations (a graphic representation of data) in an interactive, usually web-based format. Data visualization engineers have to understand principles of design so that it is easy for users to understand the data their graphics represent.
