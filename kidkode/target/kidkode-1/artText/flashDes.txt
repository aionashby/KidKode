Flash Design
Flash designers use multimedia software (different types of computer programs) to create interactive web content, animation and videos! They might work within a team on larger projects, such as animated films or even video games! Typically, multimedia artists stick to one specialty or format. For example, within video games, an artist might focus on background elements, interactive elements, level layouts, or characters. Another aspect of this job may include researching what potential audiences are interested in so that new projects can be thought of and created!
